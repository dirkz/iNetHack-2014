# iNetHack-2014

NetHack. iPhone/iPad. Graphics.

After cloning this project, make sure you have all dependencies (like Vanilla NetHack!):

```
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

Then bootstrap NetHack itself:

```
sh bin/bootstrap.sh
```

Then you can open the Xcode project and build from there.
